until recently there was a heavy use of interfaces.  Nominal typing

reference types vs value types

value types are primitve types such as int, float, double, bool, char, and struct
reference types are objects

value types are stored on the stack, reference types are stored on the heap
with a pointer to them from the stack.

this means it's easy to make reference types null - just have a null pointer
value types are harder - we can wrap them in a struct, which has a flag indicating
whether it's null or not.

but how do we prevent reference types from being null?  The ide can help us out
with the introduction of nullable reference types.  Here we assume everything isn't 
null unless we explicitly say it is with a ? operator.

From what I can see,  Swift works in a similar way,  but with the use of optionals.

A common pattern in c# is to have a TryGetValue method that returns a bool indicating
whether the value was found/parsed, and an out parameter that is the value itself.  
Show code sample.
How does the IDE know if the out parameter is set or not?  With the use of a NullIfFalse
attribute.  This is a way of telling the compiler that the out parameter is only set
if the return value is true.

// Simple type alias
using Age = System.Int32;

// Nominal vs Structural Typing
// Both classes have the same shape,  but only C1 actually implements the interface
// This is Nominal typing
print(new C1());
print(new C2());  

void print(I cls)
{
}

class C1 : I
{
    public int i { get; set; }
}

class C2
{
    public int i { get; set; }
}

interface I
{
    public int i { get; set; }
}



// Reference vs Value Types
void F1()
{
    int i = 10;
    bool b = true;
    string str = "Hello";
    var arrayOfInt = new int[10];
    var arrayOfString = new string[10];
    C c = new C();
    S s = new S();
}

void F2()
{
    const int length = 10;
    Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[length];
    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        numbers[i] += i;
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);
    }

class C
{
    public int i;
    public string s;

struct S

// Generic type constraints
class G<T, S>(T baseobj, S obj) 
    where T : I, new()      // The type argument implement I and have a public parameterless constructor
    where S : T             // T must inherit from S
{
    void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(obj.i);
    }
}

// F-bounded polymorphism (or self-referential constraint)
public interface IFluentInterface<T> where T : IFluentInterface<T>
{
    T DoSomething();

    public FluentImplementation DoSomething()
    {
        // Implementation logic
        return this;

    var c = new FluentImplementation();
    c.DoSomething().DoSomething().DoSomething();
