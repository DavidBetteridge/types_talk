        Javascript doesn't have a sound? type script,  which the designers of TypeScript tool advantage of
        when creating TypeScript.

        It uses gradual typing which is a mixture of static and dynamic typing.  It allows you to add types to your code
        but doesn't require you to do so.

        TypeScript 'complies'  down to Javascript.
