(defvar *var* 1234)
(print (type-of *var*))


the numbers are the lower/upper bounds
variables contain objects and these have Types


(setf *var* "hello")
(print (type-of *var*))

We have changed the object instead the variable.




(print (type-of 1234))
(print (class-of 1234))
The type of 1234 is INTEGER,  but it's implemented by the class INTEGER.
Change to 1234.45 if required


Create a new type from an enum, and test it
(deftype fruit () '(member :apple :orange :pear))
(print (typep ':apple '(fruit)))
(print (typep ':banana '(fruit)))


(defun eat (arg)
    (check-type arg fruit)
)
(eat :banana)


(defconstant +dinner+ :grape)
(eat dinner)
