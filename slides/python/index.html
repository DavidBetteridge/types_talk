	<h2>Python</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
        Originally Python didn't have a way of expressing types.   In Python 3 however
        type hints where added.  These aren't enforced by the runtime,  but 3rd party tools
        such as type checkers and the IDE / linters.

For example

def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length):
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."

def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length: float) -> str:
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."

So the Python interepture ignores the :float and ->str



type Vector = list[float]

Type alias and generics




but also allows new subtypes to be created

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(524313)



Functions have te type of Callable
Callable[[int], None]



x: Callable[..., str]
x can be any function which returns a string,  regardless of the number of arguments


Cannot be called

def never_call_me(arg: Never) -> None:
    pass

Union[X, Y] is equivalent to X | Y and means either X or Y.

gets better and better with each version.  But a lot of things are becoming Deprecated

A lot of the typing library seems to be aimed at the authors of static type checkers.
