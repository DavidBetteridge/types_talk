    <aside class="notes">
        Originally Python didn't have a way of expressing types.   In Python 3 however
        type hints where added.  These aren't enforced by the runtime,  but 3rd party tools
        such as type checkers and the IDE / linters.

        gets better and better with each version.  But a lot of things are becoming Deprecated

        A lot of the typing library seems to be aimed at the authors of static type checkers.
