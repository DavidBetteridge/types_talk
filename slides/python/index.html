I like to call them type hints,  rather than typing.

Note The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.

For example

def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length):
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."

def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length: float) -> str:
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."

So the Python interepture ignores the :float and ->str



type Vector = list[float]

Type alias and generics




but also allows new subtypes to be created

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(524313)



Functions have te type of Callable
Callable[[int], None]



x: Callable[..., str]
x can be any function which returns a string,  regardless of the number of arguments


Cannot be called

def never_call_me(arg: Never) -> None:
    pass

Union[X, Y] is equivalent to X | Y and means either X or Y.

gets better and better with each version.  But a lot of things are becoming Deprecated

A lot of the typing library seems to be aimed at the authors of static type checkers.
