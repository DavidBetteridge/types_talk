	<aside class="notes">
		During lockdown I got hooked on a chap called Simon solving su-do-cue problems on YouTube.   

		In a normal problem,  you are given at least 17 digits,  which ensures there is a unique solution.
		By adding extra constraints however,  you can begin with far fewer numbers,  none in this case.

		It has the normal rules about placing 1-9 in row/column/box as well as all the boxes adding up to the same number.

		It looks impossible at first glance but...

		The trick is know that the digits 1-9 add up to 45.  So each row,column and box must add to 45.
		If the centre box was say 1, then the 4 pairs must add to 44,  ie  11 each.   
		This gives only 3 possible values for the centre box. (1,5, 9)

		Show video

		Watch until 13:30

		Show solution

		The point of showing this is he is using colours to add more information to the puzzle.

		Disclaimer - the more I researched this topic the larger I found it was.  Tonight I'm going to show
		the interesting type releated parts of a range of different languages.  Other then c-sharp I'm not 
		claiming to be an expert in of them.

		Please ask questions as we go along.  I want to make this as interactive as possible.

		Originally I thought I would explain all the terms first,  and then look at the languages one by one.

		A fair question is however,  what are types?   If I asked around the room I would get a number of different answers.

		Which we can then name.  Called a type alias.
		For c-sharp,  java programmers - these are more like interfaces than classes as they
		don't have Implementation.

		In swift however....  both these primitive types and complex types are called Named Types.  A type without a 
		name (such as a tuple) is called a compound type.

		We can already see there is a lot of variation in the terminology.
