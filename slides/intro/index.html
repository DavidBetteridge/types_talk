		During lockdown I got hooked on a chap called Simon solving su-do-cue problems on YouTube.   Before we begin,  here is an snippet.	
		It has the normal rules about placing 1-9 in row/column/box as well as all the boxes adding up to the same number.
		The trick is know that the digits 1-9 add up to 45.  So each row,column and box must add to 45.
		If the centre box was say 1, then the 4 pairs must add to 44,  ie  11 each.   
		This gives only 3 possible values for the centre box. (1,5, 9)

		The point of showing this is he is using colours to represent the numbers at a higher level.
		This is a bit like how I think of Types.  As a way of adding constraints to values.

		Watch until 13:30

		Disclaimer - the more I researched this topic the larger I found it was.  Tonight I'm going to show
		the interesting type releated parts of a range of different languages.  Other then c-sharp I'm not 
		claiming to be an expert in of them.

		Please ask questions as we go along.  I want to make this as interactive as possible.

		A fair question is however,  what are types?   If I asked around the room I would get a number of different answers.

		Which we can then name.  Called a type alias.
		For c-sharp, javascipt,  java programmers - these are more like interfaces than classes as they
		don't have Implementation.
		In swift however....  both these pritive types and complex types are called Named Types.  A type without a 
		name (such as a tuple) is called a compound type.
