		We really don't want customers reporting errors.  Plus these are expensive to fix.
		
		 I expect we all agree that having comprehensive unit tests for production code is a good thing and when they catch an error before we deploy our code it's great.
		
		What is better still if the compiler detects the issue and so our code doesn't even build.
		
		However compliers these days are even better than that,  our IDE shows problems even before we save our code and also suggests better (or alternative) Implementations.
		
		In a perfect world however it would be easier to write correct code, rather than buggy code.
		For example, if you call a framework function without specifing some optional arguments,  it does the most sensible thing.  e.g console.writeline without a string you would expect to write just a carriage return.

		Types can help with 3, 4 and 5

		What types give is information.  Both to us and also to the compiler.
		Information at a given point in a program,  and also how information flows through a program.
