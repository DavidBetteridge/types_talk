Dynamic and weak typing


let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean


Types are
boolean, number,  bigint,  string, symbol, null and undefined


const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421


only primitive types get coerced
For objects it first tries valueOf() and then toString()

For example,  arrays
[1,2,3].toString()
[].toString()


So we now only need to worry about primitive types

+<Anything> converts it to a number.
<LHS> + string converts the LHS side to a string.
<LHS> - <RHS> both sides will be converted to numbers.  true â€” '2' gives -1
    

parseInt(1/0, 19)   is 18!

1/0 is infinity which is coercied into a string

Parsed one digit at a time.  I is 18 in base 19.   N isn't valid.
