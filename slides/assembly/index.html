        Explain instrucions

		The computer has no idea what the values 1234 and 5678 represent. It only knows that they are numbers. 
        It does not know if add these two numbers together and using them to reference a memory address is sensible.
        Without any more information,  is it possible to determine information about the values from their usage.

		It appears that neither we or the computer can't tell what the type of a variable is from it's usage / context.  
        So it can't help determine if our code is correct and does something sensisble.   
        Along with a name and value of a variable,  we need some additional information.  Such as it's type.
